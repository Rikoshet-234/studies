Japseu
======

Japseu is just another Python shoot'em up. Neither fun factor nor purpose of
the game exists, so do not expect to enjoy the experience in any possible way.
It is just Python course final project with poorly crafted graphics and
design, nothing more.


Controls
--------

  * left and right arrows - movement
  * spacebar - jumping
  * right control - shooting
  * escape - quit game


Dependencies and running
------------------------

The game requires you to have Python 3.3 with installed Pygame library. To run 
code on the Python 2.* some small adjustments are needed (some stuff related to
StringIO I believe). Anyway, once you have these, to run the game simply type:

    python3 japseu.py
