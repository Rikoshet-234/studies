Studies
=======

Repository containing things that university wants me to do. It implies that comments in sources are mostly in Polish.

Folders
-------

### afitsd
A few code snippets for *Functional Algorithms and Persistent Data Structures*. The course was based mainly on *Purely Functional Data Structures* by Chris Okasaki, so these are probably solutions to the book exercises.

### afp
Slides and exercise solutions for *Advanced Functional Programming* seminar.

### aisd
Bunch of small programs for the course of *Algorithms and Data Structures*. Most of them just reads data from standard input, solves particular problem and writes solution to standard output. They are supposed to be judged by one of the automatic online testers so I didn't care much about code design. Name of file maps to the task codename in Themis judge.

### anum
Programs and documents related to the course of *Numerical Analysis*.

### ask
Short MIPS assembly sources for the course of *Architectures of Computer Systems*.

### coq
Assignment solutions for *Fundamentals of Programming Languages in Coq* lecture. Some sources are chapters copied from the *Software Foundations* book by Benjamin Pierce with exercise sections filled-in.

### esys
Programs created for *Embedded Systems* course. Most of them require Arduino IDE, but some will work with a classic C compiler.

### networks
Programs for the course of *Computer Networks*. They are doing pretty low-level networking stuff and make heavy use of Unix libraries.

### progl
Folder dedicated something named *Programming L*. But do not be misled by the name - it has nothing to do with everyday programming. In fact, it is actually course about unusual programming: Prolog, Haskell, purely functional data structures and so on.

### ruby
Ruby sources for the course of, well, *Ruby programming language*. Although I am pretty familiar with Ruby itself I cannot say the same thing about Rails. So this folder contains my first steps in Rails world.

### python
Python sources for the course of *extended Python* (not sure about the *extended* part though). Everything in that folder should be compatible with Python 3.

### unix
Scripts and small C programs for the course of *Working in UNIX environment*. Most of them should work on any POSIX compatible system (tested on Linux and Solaris).
