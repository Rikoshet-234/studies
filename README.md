Studies
=======

Repository containing things that university wants me to do. It implies that comments in sources are mostly in Polish.

Folders
-------

### aisd
Bunch of small programs for the course of *Algorithms and Data Structures*. Most of them just reads data from standard input, solves particular problem and writes solution to standard output. They are supposed to be judged by one of the automatic online testers so I didn't care much about code design. Name of file maps to the task codename in Themis judge.

### anum
Programs and documents related to the course of *Numerical Analysis*.

### ask
Short MIPS assembly sources for the course of *Architectures of Computer Systems*.

### networks
Programs for the course of *Computer Networks*. They are doing pretty low-level networking stuff and make heavy use of Unix libraries.

### progl
Folder dedicated something named *Programming L*. But do not be misled by the name - it has nothing to do with everyday programming. In fact, it is actually course about unusual programming: Prolog, Haskell, purely functional data structures and so on.

### ruby
Ruby sources for the course of, well, *Ruby programming language*. Although I am pretty familiar with Ruby itself I cannot say the same thing about Rails. So this folder contains my first steps in Rails world.

### python
Python sources for the course of *extended Python* (not sure about the *extended* part though). Everything in that folder should be compatible with Python 3.


### unix
Scripts and small C programs for the course of *Working in UNIX environment*. Most of them should work on any POSIX compatible system (tested on Linux and Solaris).
